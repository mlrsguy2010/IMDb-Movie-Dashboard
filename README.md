# IMDb-Movie-Dashboard
Data visualization of IMDb Movies created in Microsoft Excel

This project is a dashboard created entirely in Microsoft Excel. The dashboard was made through the use of multiple pivot tables. Pivot Charts were then added based upon those pivot tables. Finally, slicers were included to allow users to view various countries and movie ratings. There is also a timeline control included to add additional interactivity to the dashboard.
